/**
 * Annotates a method that creates a {@link Collection} of {@link LabelValue}

 * {@link SendableChooser} to a {@link Command}.
 * <p>
 * The method must conform to the following prototype:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public static Collection&lt;LabelValue&lt;String, Command&gt;&gt; name(T container);
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * The type T is an object passed to the constructor of the autonomous command
 * providing access to the robot subsystems. This is typically an instance of
 * <code>RobotContainer</code>, but could be another type used to manage the
